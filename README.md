# keyboard-sound
Improve the sound of your keyboard.
Play the sounds of a nice mechanical keyboard (or anything you want, really) as you type!

Inspired by Glarses' video ["How To Make Any Keyboard Sound AMAZING."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_9vXJZVT54)
The sound clips used here are his.

Should work on all operating systems, with Python 3.4 or higher.
(Though at the moment, this is only tested on Linux with Python 3.8.)

It also works in the background; just leave the program running in the terminal and type in another program!

# How to use
This tries to assume no development knowledge, but reading a tutorial on basic usage of the terminal/command prompt will be helpful.
1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) if it isn't already.
   (Windows does not come with it preinstalled. macOS does, and Linux usually does.)
   This will run keyboard-sound.
1. Download this code using the green button at the top right of this page, and unzip it.
1. Open a terminal/command prompt.
1. Install pipenv with `pip3 install --user pipenv`.
   This is a program that will manage some of the code that keyboard-sound needs.
1. Change directories to where you unzipped the files.
1. Run `pipenv update`.
1. Run `pipenv run python3 keyboard-sound.py`
1. Voila!
